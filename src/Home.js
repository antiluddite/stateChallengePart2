        These are a series of challenges to practice using props and state.
        They are all written using functional components, not class components.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can switch between the 9 challenges using the top navbar.
        The #1 challenge is the easiest, the #9 challenge is the hardest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each challenge will ask you to correctly connect the ParentComponent
        and the ChildComponent.

    </div>
